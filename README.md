Project Overview
In order to improve my skills in Express.js, I built this project as a simple CRUD application. 
The project is designed to provide a hands-on experience with building a backend system and integrating various essential tools and technologies for modern web development.

Key Features
Database: Used MySQL as the database to store and manage data.
Integrated Prisma ORM for an efficient and type-safe interaction with the database.

Validation: Incorporated express-validator to create robust and reusable validation schemas for incoming requests.
Ensured all input data is sanitized and validated before processing.
